Team Name: The Scroll Trolls

Project Description:

UselessForm.exe is the most pointlessly brilliant web form you‚Äôll ever (try to) fill. It refuses to scroll unless you make noise into your microphone. Loud noises = more scrolling. Silence = eternal stuckness.

But that‚Äôs not all ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt your regular form. It‚Äôs a trolling masterpiece. The questions are endless, bizarre, and slightly annoying. Just when you think you‚Äôve reached the end‚Ä¶ surprise, there‚Äôs more. Each reload takes you back to the very top, making progress feel like a myth.

In short: It‚Äôs a form designed to waste your time, test your vocal cords, and make judges laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all.
  



The Problem (that doesn't exist):
People have it too easy scrolling with their mouse, trackpad, or finger. Where‚Äôs the challenge? Where‚Äôs the drama?

The Solution (that nobody asked for):
We removed normal scrolling entirely and replaced it with Shout-to-Scroll‚Ñ¢. Want to fill the form? Better start yelling, clapping, or making goat noises Also get trolled by your own form to fill.
